# First-order development ideas

1.  ☐ Make a function to call the app, with parameters such as
    1.  ☐ directory holding files
    2.  ☐ file suffix (.odf or .cnv by default)
    3.  ☐ something about default scheme (for flags)
    4.  ☐ name of database file
    5.  ☐ etc
2.  ☐ Have an interface to turn on suggested QC actions, e.g.
    1.  ☐ highlight density inversions
    2.  ☐ trim-to-descent
3.  ☐ Have an interface to accept/reject suggested actions (and maybe
    record this in the database).

# Second-order development ideas
