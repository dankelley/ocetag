# Development Ideas

1. [ ] Make a function that calls the app.  The function should have args such as
   a. [ ] directory holding files
   b. [ ] file suffix (.odf or .cnv by default)
   c. [ ] something about default scheme (for flags)
   d. [ ] name of database file
   e. [ ] etc
2. [ ] Have an interface to turn on suggested QC actions, e.g.
   a. [ ] highlight density inversions
   b. [ ] trim-to-descent
3. [ ] Have an interface to accept/reject suggested actions (and maybe record this in the database).
